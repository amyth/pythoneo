# pythoneo
A simple open source python package that makes it easier to query a neo4j database. We had used py2neo in couple of our projects but as the there is no option to adjust the timeout settings for individual queries, we wrote a simple package to connect to a neo4j database to that lets you set timeout for each individual query.
